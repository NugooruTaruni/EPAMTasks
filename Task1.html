                Women’s Premier League: Mumbai turns UP’s eliminator
            </h2>

                It was an evening where Mumbai Indians could not put a foot wrong. After a slight hiccup towards 
                the end of the league phase where they ended up losing two matches on the trot and failed to make 
                the final directly, on Friday, they rediscovered their title credentials. Playing UP Warriorz in 
                the Eliminator at the DY Patil Stadium in blistering home support, Mumbai Indians won by 72 runs 
                and set up a final with Delhi Capitals.

                From ‘washing powder Nirma’ for BJP leaders to BRS’s Kavitha next to liquor bottles, a poster war in Telangana
            </h2>

                The war was stepped up a notch after the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) scanner fell on Kavitha — 
                Telangana Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao’s (KCR) daughter —  in connection with the alleged 
                Delhi liquor policy scam. The BJP and the BRS, however, have taken no official responsibility for 
                the posters.
